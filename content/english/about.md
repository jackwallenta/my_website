Hi, I'm Jack. I am currently a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Data Science. 

I was born and raised in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota where I grew up playing hockey, baseball, and golf.

Other than sports, my interests include architecture, investing, technology, geography, music, and playing guitar.

As I learned to code with languages like Java, Python, and R, I decided to create a project that was not assigned as homework. I built this website entirely from scratch using RStudio, GitHub, Terminal, and a theme from [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/). As my coding skills expand, I intend to improve this site.

If you are interested in building your own website but do not know where to start, feel free to contact me as I would be happy to help.
